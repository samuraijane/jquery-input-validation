# jQuery Input Validation
This application shows students learning front-end validation some of the logic we can use to safely receive input from the user and how to check for a properly-formatted email address. The UI employs input fields for a username, which must be an email address, and a password.

Please note that the password characters are not hidden. You would never do this in a real application but we do not hide them so that you can more easily test a variety of characters.
